# Min-caml-for-C

This is the team project for CS421 programming languages and compilers.

This is a reproduction of the compiler mentioned in paper "MinCaml: A Simple and Efficient Compiler for a Minimal Functional Language". Different from the original compiler, this version is specifically targeted for a subset of the programming language C.
